# Skate 3 Recomp

Skate 3 Recomp is an early Windows build that brings Skate 3 toward a native PC
runtime with a simple setup flow, PC settings, keyboard/mouse support, diagnostics,
and 1080p/60fps+ experimentation.  It is in-game playable.

This is still work in progress. Expect bugs, missing polish, and occasional
breakage while the project is being brought up.

This repository does not include Skate 3 game files, decrypted executables,
generated game output, caches, saves, or captures. You must provide your own
legally obtained Xbox 360 game dump.

## Easy Setup

### Windows package

Use this flow if you downloaded the Windows zip from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/portingpete/skate3-recomp/releases/latest).

1. Download `Skate3Recomp-Windows-v0.1.3-alpha.zip` from the latest Release.
2. Extract the zip somewhere easy to find.
3. Open the folder named `Skate 3 Files`.
4. Put your Skate 3 dump in that folder.
5. Double-click `Setup Skate 3 Recomp.cmd`.
6. Press `Set Up Game`.

Leave `Start game when ready` checked if you want the setup tool to launch the
game automatically when it finishes.

### Linux package

The Linux package follows the same folder-drop convention:

1. Extract the Linux zip.
2. Open the folder named `Skate 3 Files`.
3. Put your Skate 3 dump in that folder.
4. Run `Launch Skate 3 Recomp.sh`.

A `.desktop` launcher is also included for Linux desktop environments.

## What Goes In `Skate 3 Files`

The setup tool looks for these files and folders:

- `default.xex`
- `default.xex_uncrypted.xex`
- `data`
- `nxeart`

`default.xex_uncrypted.xex` is the decrypted game executable. If it is missing,
setup will stop and ask you to add it.

### Decrypting `default.xex` With XexTool

Use this only with your own legally obtained Skate 3 dump. Keep the original
`default.xex` in place and create a separate decrypted copy:

```text
xextool -e d -c b -o default.xex_uncrypted.xex default.xex
```

After running the command, `Skate 3 Files` should contain both `default.xex` and
`default.xex_uncrypted.xex`, plus the `data` folder.

## What The Setup Button Does

The setup tool keeps your original dump untouched. It copies the files into a
working folder, prepares the runtime folder used by the launcher, creates the
needed save/cache folders, and then starts the normal game launcher if the
auto-start box is checked.

After setup, use:

```text
Launch Skate 3 Recomp.cmd
```

That launcher opens the PC settings screen first, so you can choose resolution,
fullscreen, FPS counter, and other options before the game starts.

## If Setup Fails

Check the `Skate 3 Files` folder first. Most setup problems are caused by one of
these:

- The files were placed inside an extra nested folder.
- `data` is missing.
- `default.xex_uncrypted.xex` is missing.
- The dump is incomplete.

for Linux / Docker builds. For attribution covering Skate 3 Recomp and its

## Current Status

- The normal launcher shows PC settings before the game starts.
- The game has an optional readable FPS counter.
- Experimental ultrawide Hor+ support is available for testing. Gameplay uses a
  wider projection while startup, menus, and videos use a separate non-stretched
  presentation path. Treat this as experimental.
- The windowed-mode startup crash/launch stall is fixed in current builds.
- The setup GUI prepares the working/runtime folders automatically.
- Gameplay bring-up is still under active investigation, including known physics
  and collision issues.

Skate 3 Recomp is built from a custom ReXGlue branch. It is not an official
upstream ReXGlue release.

ReXGlue converts Xbox 360 PowerPC code into portable C++ that runs natively on
modern platforms. It is heavily rooted in the foundations of
[Xenia](https://github.com/xenia-project), and its ahead-of-time C++ generation
approach is inspired by [XenonRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp)
and [rexdex's recompiler](https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler).
